# Sample Project for AppSheet

This sample React web application retrives information from an external source (REST API) and displays 5 youngest users with valid US telephone numbers.

## Interface

AppSheet truly cares about information and data. I believe that it makes sense to go with a clutter-free interface. I also want the app to make use of visualization tools to help users understand the data being presented.

The end result is a beautiful web app that focuses on presenting the data in an attractive and meaningful way.
